# EveBlogs
This is part of a new meta blog tool.
It automaticly searches the RSS feeds of other blogs to create a list of the latest blogposts.

This software is not yet in a usable condition.

Note: This is my first project of this scale, so many things will not be "best-practice". I also am not a native English speaker, so plese have some mercy with my writing.
Tips are allways welcome.
